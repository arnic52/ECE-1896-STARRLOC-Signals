%% get example message samples

% downsample the message to required samples

% define signal parameters from file data

time_span_sec = N / sample_rate;                                            % determine the length of time of the audio file
sample_period = 1/sample_rate;                                              % determine the time between samples
t = linspace(0, time_span_sec - sample_period, N);                          % generate linear time vector

% get the first autocorrelation coefficient from windows of message

num_windows = floor(N / samples_per_window);                                    % get the number of windows from the file (round down)

% slice the set of windows from the file

    window_autocorr_0(i) = sum(curr_window(1:samples_per_window-k) .* curr_window(k+1:samples_per_window));

    % against the total power multiplied by some threshold
    window_voice_pres(i) = window_autocorr_1(i) > window_autocorr_0(i)*thresh;
